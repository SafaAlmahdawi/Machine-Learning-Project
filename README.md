# Machine-Learning-Project


Welcome to the Machine Learning Honors Project!

This project provides an opportunity to apply various machine learning algorithms to predict rainfall using a dataset sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a classifier that predicts whether there will be rain the following day based on historical weather data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found here. It includes various weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Data Preprocessing
Ensure data cleanliness: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling if necessary.
Algorithms Used
The project involves applying several classification algorithms to build predictive models. The algorithms used include:

Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Model Evaluation Metrics


Evaluation of the models will be based on the following metrics:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss (if applicable)
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
