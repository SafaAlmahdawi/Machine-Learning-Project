# Machine Learning Project: Rainfall Prediction

Welcome to the Machine Learning Project!

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a classifier predicting rainfall the following day using historical weather data.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project originates from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and contains various weather-related features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 

## Data Preprocessing

To ensure data quality, the following steps will be taken:
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables
- Perform feature scaling if required

## Algorithms Used

The project involves implementing several classification algorithms:
1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Model Evaluation Metrics

The models will be evaluated based on:
- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss (if applicable)
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2-Score

### Deliverables

- Jupyter notebook with code implementation
